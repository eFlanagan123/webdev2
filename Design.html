		<h4>My first assignment that I had to do was to design a mask  I got my idea for the Smiley mask from the film Smiley which is a horror film. I thought this would be a good idea because it was around Halloween time .The materials I used to make my mask included news paper and glue to make paper mache , a balloon ,masking tape ,glue, liquid latex, scissors, paint and fake blood. </h4>
